 ## Considerations
1. The Python/Django code is large, so the repository only shows a preview the database model, functions and stored procedures needed for the base and bones of the project.
2. You can download the zip file if you wich to see the code.
3. It uses a virtual environment wish might need recreation before running the code, since the framework needs to point local paths to work as expected.
